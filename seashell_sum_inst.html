				* The aim of this internet-based game is to determine a sum that equals 10.<br>
				* A fun fact and a random number between 0 to 10 will be given to you.<br>
				* You are now required to choose a number from 0 to 10 whose sum is equal to 10.<br>
				* It's an enjoyable and demanding approach to develop your talents and learn new things at the same time!!!<br><br>
				<b> RULES </b>
				<br><br>
				* The player will guess each number that they think adds up to 10 one at a time.<br>
				* As an example, if the player is shown the numbers 3 and then instructed to enter the number they think is the right guess (i.e. 7) for the sum to reach 10, they will have created a pair that is legitimate since 3+7-10.<br>
				*The player wins if the sum is 10 .

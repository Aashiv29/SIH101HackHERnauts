				* Jumble Quest is a fun and educative single-player web game that will improve your knowledge of words and word-solving ability.<br>
				* In order to make understandable words in this game, you must untangle a collection of scrambled words.<br>
				* So, embark on Quest and see how many words you are able to decode if you're up for a brainteaser adventure and want to enhance your language skills.<br><br>
				<b> RULES </b>
				<br><br>
				* The ability of word unscrambling is at the heart of the game.<br>
				* You are given an anonymous word that has been completely jumbled by its letters.<br>
				* In order to score, your mission is to rearrange these letters into the correct English word. <br>
